In 2001, Kevin McCabe, Daniel Houser, Lee Ryan, Vernon Smith and Theodore Trouard published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science called "A functional imaging study of cooperation in two-person reciprocal exchange" studyong how computations in the evolved brain made markets smarter.
